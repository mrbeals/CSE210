Hello!

This program works best the more time is invested in building a large quantity of items!

The point of this program was to create a inventory/bank system that can store multiple different types of items. 

Added was a way to aquire new items into your inventory through the frog merchant.

To aquire items from teh frog merchant, you need to create items for him to have. 

after you have obtained an item, it will be added to your inventory (if it was a key item it will automatically be placed in your key item inventory) 

you can manage your inventory, and bank through their respective menus. 

after you have finished, make sure to select save before you quit to save to files. 

when you load up again, you can select the load button, which will load your data for you, and you can pick up where you left off. 

when addind items, remember to access them later, the names are case sensitive!
